## 📖 Overview

**SHS Player** is a free, open-source, ad-free Android multimedia application that plays local and network video, audio, and live IPTV streams. It is a heavily-extended fork of [Next Player](https://github.com/anilbeesetti/nextplayer) by Anil Kumar Beesetti, re-architected and rebranded by **Sajjad Hussain Shobuj (SHS)** with a focus on three pillars:

- **Privacy-first design** — all media processing happens on-device. No tracking, no telemetry, no ads.
- **Maximum format coverage** — ships *two* playback engines (AndroidX Media3/ExoPlayer **and** LibVLC) so virtually every container, codec, and streaming protocol "just works".
- **Power-user features** — Privacy Vault, Wi-Fi file transfer, IPTV browsing, voice changer, AB-repeat, sleep timer, bookmarks, online subtitle search, video trim, and much more.

The app is written in **100% Kotlin** with **Jetpack Compose** for the entire UI layer, follows **Clean Architecture** across **12 Gradle modules**, uses **Hilt** for dependency injection, **Room** + **DataStore** for persistence, and is localised into **40+ languages**.

> **Latest version:** `0.15.7` (versionCode `54`)
> **Min Android:** 6.0 (API 23) · **Target:** Android 16 (API 36)
> **Application ID:** `dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer` (retained for upstream compatibility)

## 🔥 Why SHS Player?

Most Android players fall into two camps: feature-rich but bloated/proprietary (MX Player, VLC), or clean but minimal (Next Player, Just Player). SHS Player sits in the rare middle — a clean, modern, Material 3 UI with power-user capabilities that no other open-source player currently bundles together:

| Capability | SHS Player | Next Player | VLC | MX Player |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Dual engine (Media3 + VLC) | ✅ | ❌ | VLC only | Proprietary |
| Privacy Vault (encrypted on-device) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Wi-Fi file transfer (no internet) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| IPTV / M3U live TV browser | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ (manual) | ❌ |
| Built-in music library | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| QR scanner + TrebleShot share | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| AB-repeat, sleep timer, bookmarks | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Voice changer (pitch shift) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Video → audio converter | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Video trim + reverse play | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (trim) |
| Online subtitle search | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| 100% open source, no ads | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## 🧩 Feature Comparison

### vs. upstream Next Player
SHS Player inherits Next Player's entire codebase (Media3 player, Material 3 UI, Compose architecture, settings screens, media library) and then layers on top:

- **New top-level navigation** — a 5-tab bottom bar (Videos · Music · Watch TV · Me · Telegram) instead of a single Videos screen.
- **A separate Music library** with files / folders / favourites / recent / playlists tabs and a dedicated audio player activity.
- **An IPTV module** that bundles 8 free iptv-org playlists and parses any `.m3u` URL.
- **A Privacy Vault** that moves media into app-private storage behind a SHA-256 password and optional biometric unlock.
- **A Wi-Fi file transfer server** (NanoHTTPD) that lets you push/pull files from any browser on the same LAN — no internet, no cloud.
- **A QR scanner** (CameraX + MLKit) and a TrebleShot-compatible QR share format for direct device-to-device transfers.
- **A VLC engine** for files / streams / codecs that ExoPlayer can't handle.
- **Voice changer, AB-repeat, sleep timer, bookmarks, favourites, video trim, video→audio, reverse play, screenshot, mirror, audio delay** in the player.
- **Online subtitle search** via OpenSubtitles (hardcoded API key).
- **Volume boost up to 200%** via `LoudnessEnhancer`.
- **A custom crash reporter** that captures the stack trace *and* `logcat` output and offers Share / Copy / Restart.
- **A premium Cupertino + Material 3 hybrid theme** with iOS-blue / iOS-pink accents and a pure-black OLED mode.
- **An animated splash screen** with logo pulse and gradient.
- **bKash / UPI / PayPal / Ko-fi / crypto donation** hooks tuned for the South-Asian developer community.

## 🚀 Detailed Feature Set

### 🎥 Video Player

The video player is the heart of SHS Player and the most feature-dense module in the project.

**Engines**
- **AndroidX Media3 / ExoPlayer 1.9.2** (default) — supports DASH, HLS, RTSP, SmoothStreaming, and every codec Android ships natively (H.263, H.264, H.265/HEVC, MPEG-4, VP8, VP9, AV1).
- **LibVLC 3.6.0-eap5** (fallback) — for files/streams/codecs that ExoPlayer can't handle. Configured with `:input-fast-seek`, `--no-drop-late-frames`, hardware acceleration with software fallback, and network caching. VLC also provides sample-accurate audio delay (microsecond precision) and a native 10-band equalizer that ExoPlayer can't match.

**Playback controls**
- Play / pause / seek bar with 10-second seek increments (configurable 1–60 s) and previous-sync seek parameters.
- Fast seek with configurable threshold.
- Skip silence (Media3's `setSkipSilenceEnabled`).
- Long-press to fast-forward at a configurable speed (0.2×–4.0×).
- Background playback with a branded media notification (`NOTIFICATION_ID = 1001` for ExoPlayer, `1002` for VLC).
- Picture-in-Picture with custom `RemoteAction`s and 32-bit-safe aspect-ratio coercion.
- Loop modes: off / loop all / loop one.
- Shuffle.

**Audio features**
- **Audio track selector** — pick any embedded audio track; remembers your last selection per file.
- **Audio delay / sync** — offset audio by −3000 ms to +3000 ms (VLC gives microsecond precision).
- **5/10-band audio equalizer** — uses Android's native `android.media.audiofx.Equalizer`. Save and load EQ profiles.
- **Voice changer** — 5 pitch presets (chipmunk, deep, robot, etc.) via `PlaybackParameters(pitch)`.
- **Volume boost up to 200%** via `LoudnessEnhancer`.
- **System volume panel** integration.

**Video features**
- **Video equalizer** — brightness / contrast / saturation in −100…+100 range, applied via `ColorMatrix` on a `TextureView` with Rec.709 luminance weights. Profiles are persisted.
- **Video content scale** — Best Fit / Stretch / Crop / 100%.
- **Zoom & pan** — pinch to zoom (0.25×–4×), drag to pan, with a pan/zoom lock to disambiguate gestures.
- **Rotation** — rotate the video in 90° increments; auto-rotate based on video orientation; or follow device sensor.
- **Screen mirror** (horizontal flip).
- **Screenshot capture** via `PixelCopy` from the `SurfaceView`.
- **Trim video** — in-app slider dialog that calls `MediaExtractor` + `MediaMuxer` to export a clip.
- **Video → audio** — extracts the audio track into an `.m4a` using `MediaExtractor` + `MediaMuxer`.
- **Reverse play** — plays the video backwards.

**Subtitle features**
- **Subtitle track selector** for embedded subs; **long-press** the subtitle icon to load an external subtitle file.
- **Online subtitle search** via OpenSubtitles (embedded and online tabs).
- **Subtitle text encoding** auto-detection via `juniversalchardet`; manual override in settings.
- **Subtitle styling** — font (Default / Monospace / Sans Serif / Serif), bold, size 10–60, background, embedded styles, or use the system caption style (opens Android's captioning settings).
- **Subtitle delay** sync.

**Gestures**
- **Horizontal drag** — seek (with configurable sensitivity 0.1–2.0).
- **Left vertical drag** — brightness (with optional system-level persistence).
- **Right vertical drag** — volume.
- **Pinch** — zoom.
- **Double tap** — configurable per zone: none / play-pause / fast-forward & rewind / both.
- **Long press** — toggle fast-forward at configurable speed.
- **Controls lock** — hide all controls and prevent touches (great for kids).

**Playlist & session**
- **Playlist panel** — reorder, remove, jump to any item.
- **Bookmarks** — save timestamped bookmarks per video (Room `BookmarkDao`).
- **Favourites** — star videos; filter the library by favourites.
- **AB-repeat** — loop a segment between two timestamps; polling-based playback loop.
- **Sleep timer** — stop playback after N minutes.
- **Resume** — pick up where you left off; configurable Yes/No.
- **Remember selections** — last audio/subtitle track, brightness, playback speed.
- **Recently played** — quick-resume from the library FAB.

**Intent API (MX Player compatible)**
- Accepts `android.intent.action.VIEW` with `video/*` and `audio/*`.
- Supports MX-Player-compatible intent extras via `PlayerApi` (title, position, headers, subtitles, etc.) — so third-party apps that target MX Player will work with SHS Player out of the box.

**Player controls customisation**
- `CustomizablePlayerControlsRow` — drag-to-reorder scaffold for control buttons (PLAYit-style).
- Control buttons position — left or right.
- Controller auto-hide timeout — 1–60 s (default applies).
- Hide player buttons background — transparent button backgrounds for a cleaner overlay.

---

### 🎵 Music & Audio Player

A standalone music library accessible from the bottom navigation, separate from the video library:

- **Five tabs** — Files / Folders / Favourites / Recent / Playlists.
- **List and grid layouts** with sort by title, duration, date, or size.
- **Custom playlists** persisted via `SharedPreferences`.
- **Dedicated `AudioPlayerActivity`** — separate from `PlayerActivity` (the video host) to avoid lifecycle conflicts.
- **Rotating vinyl album art** — extracted on-the-fly via `MediaMetadataRetriever`.
- **Audio visualiser** — real `android.media.audiofx.Visualizer` waveform.
- **Queue bottom sheet** with drag-to-reorder.
- **Audio settings dialog** — speed, skip-silence, EQ.
- **Notification playback controls**.
- **ServiceConnection leak fix** — explicit `isBound` tracking to prevent the crash that plagues many Media3 audio apps.

---

### 📺 IPTV / Live TV

A full IPTV browser (`WatchTvScreen` + `M3uParser`):

- **M3U parser** handles `http`, `content`, and `file` sources; extracts `tvg-logo`, `group-title`, `tvg-id`, `tvg-name`.
- Supports `http`, `rtmp`, `rtsp`, and `udp` stream URLs.
- Sends User-Agent `SHSPlayer/1.4` for streams that require it.
- **Ships with 8 free iptv-org playlists** baked in: USA, India, UK, Sports, News, Movies, Kids, Music.
- **Searchable & grouped** by `group-title`.
- **Launches into `PlayerActivity`** for full-screen playback.
- Add your own `.m3u` URL or local file at runtime.

---

### 🔒 Privacy Vault

A fully on-device media vault (`PrivacyFolderScreen`, ~927 lines):

- **SHA-256 password** protection with security-question recovery.
- **Optional `BiometricPrompt`** unlock (fingerprint / face).
- Files are **moved out of `MediaStore`** into `context.filesDir/vault/{videos,music}/` — invisible to other apps and gallery.
- **Restore flow** uses `MediaStore.IS_PENDING` + `RELATIVE_PATH` on Android Q+ and `MediaScannerConnection` pre-Q.
- **Vault playback** routes through `FileProvider` URIs so vault files never touch `MediaStore` again.
- Works for both videos and music.

---

### 📡 Wi-Fi File Transfer

A local-only file transfer server (`FileTransferScreen`, ~770 lines) — **no internet required, no cloud, no third party**:

- **`VaultHttpServer` extends NanoHTTPD** on a random port (10000–65000).
- Serves an HTML upload page **and** accepts both `multipart/form-data` and `application/octet-stream` POSTs.
- **16-character UUID auth token** validated from query string, `session.parms`, or `X-Auth-Token` header.
- **Path-traversal protection** — requests can't escape the vault directory.
- **ZXing `QRCodeWriter`** encodes `http://<ip>:<port>?token=<auth>` into a scannable QR.
- Sender side uses `HttpURLConnection` with byte-level progress reporting.
- Works on any device with a browser — phone, tablet, laptop, desktop.

---

### 📱 QR Scanner & Share

- **`QrScannerScreen`** — CameraX (Preview + ImageAnalysis) + **MLKit Barcode Scanning** in a full-screen dialog.
- Notable engineering fix: binds to the **Activity's** `LifecycleOwner` (not the Dialog's) to avoid the black-screen bug that affects CameraX-in-dialog patterns.
- `PERFORMANCE` PreviewView mode + `post{}` deferral until the Surface is ready.
- **`QrShareFormat`** — TrebleShot-compatible QR format for device-to-device sharing:
  - Hotspot mode: `hs;pin;ssid;bssid;password;end`
  - Wi-Fi LAN mode: `wf;pin;ssid;bssid;ip;end`
- **`HotspotManager`** — wraps `WifiManager.startLocalOnlyHotspot` (API 26+) for sending without an existing Wi-Fi network, plus a `SecureRandom` 6-digit `PinGenerator`.

---

### 🗂️ Media Library

The media library (`MediaPickerScreen`, ~834 lines) is the main browser:

- **View modes** — `VIDEOS`, `FOLDERS`, `FOLDER_TREE` (folders + videos in one grid with section headers).
- **Layouts** — List (1 column) and Grid (multi-column; column count auto-computed from 90dp/130dp minimums).
- **Sort** — 5 keys (Title / Duration / Date / Size / Location) × 2 orders (Asc / Desc) with natural/numeric "chunk" comparator. Order label changes per key (A-Z vs Z-A, Shortest vs Longest, Oldest vs Newest, Smallest vs Largest).
- **Quick Settings dialog** — view mode, layout, sort-by, sort order, and 7 toggleable field chips (Duration, Extension, Path, Played progress, Resolution, Size, Thumbnail).
- **Fast scroll** — custom `FastScrollLazyColumn` / `FastScrollLazyGrid` with a draggable thumb and auto-hiding popup showing the folder path segment or first letter.
- **Pull-to-refresh** triggers `MediaSynchronizer.refresh`.
- **Search bar** with animated visibility; filters both videos and folders.
- **Selection mode** — long-press to enter; haptic feedback; pill showing "N/M selected"; select-all/deselect-all; back-handler clears.
- **Selection actions sheet** (animated bottom sheet) — Play, Favourite/Unfavourite, Rename (single video), Share, Info (single video), Privacy (move to vault), Delete (with confirmation when the OS won't ask).
- **Video Info dialog** — file (name, location, size, duration, format), video track (title, codec, WxH, frame rate, bitrate), audio tracks (title, codec, sample rate, sample format, bitrate, channels, channel layout, language), subtitle tracks (title, codec, language).
- **Rename** dialog with OutlinedTextField, auto-focus after 200 ms (rotation-safe).
- **Favourites** — `FavoriteDao` / `FavoriteEntity` in Room; filter icon in the top bar; star/unstar in the selection sheet.
- **Recently played highlight** — title and supporting text tinted with `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` when the "Mark last played media" preference is on.
- **Played progress bar** — 4dp bottom bar on thumbnails using `video.playedPercentage`.
- **FAB menu** — Material 3 `FloatingActionButtonMenu` + `ToggleFloatingActionButton` with three items: Open network stream (URL dialog), Open local video (`ActivityResultContracts.GetContent("video/*")`), Recently played (jumps to the last-played video). Auto-collapses on scroll or selection.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

SHS Player follows **Clean Architecture** across **12 Gradle modules**, with strict dependency direction:

```
                        ┌──────────────┐
                        │     :app     │  ← Single-Activity Compose host, navigation, splash,
                        │              │    bottom bar, music/IPTV/vault/transfer/QR screens,
                        │              │    crash reporter, FileProvider.

              ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │  :core:datastore (typed JSON DataStore)              │
              │  :core:model (pure Kotlin @Serializable types)       │
              │  :core:common (Logger, Utils, Dispatchers, extensions)│
              └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dependency direction:** `app` → `feature:*` → `core:*` → (leaf: `core:common`, `core:model`). No cycles. `core:ui` is Compose-only (no Hilt). `core:model` is pure JVM (no Android). `core:database` is the only module that knows about Room.

**Key patterns**
- **Hilt 2.57.2** for DI across every module except `core:model` and `core:ui`.
- **ViewModel + StateFlow** for screen state; **`@Stable` Compose state holders** for player state (17 of them in `feature:player`).
- **Single-Activity architecture** — `MainActivity` hosts a Compose `NavHost`; `PlayerActivity` and `AudioPlayerActivity` are the only other activities.
- **Repository pattern** — `MediaRepository` and `PreferencesRepository` interfaces in `core:data` with `Local*` implementations bound via Hilt.
- **Use-case layer** — `core/domain` has 5 use cases that compose the three sorters + folder-tree builder + playlist builder.
- **DataStore with typed JSON serializers** — `ApplicationPreferences` and `PlayerPreferences` are `@Serializable` data classes persisted via `DataStoreFactory.create` with custom `Serializer` and `Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }`.
- **Room v4 with 3 migrations and 4 exported schemas** — `MediaDatabase` v4 has 8 entities and `fallbackToDestructiveMigration(false)`.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### For end users

1. **Download the latest APK** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/The-JDdev/SHS-Player/releases).
2. Allow "Install from unknown sources" for your browser/file manager.
3. Open the APK and install.
4. Launch **SHS Player** and grant the media-permission prompt on first run.

> **Android 13+:** Only `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` / `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` are requested.  
> **Android 12 and below:** `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` on Android 10 and below).  
> **Privacy Vault** uses app-private storage — no extra permission needed.

---

## 🔧 Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 17** (set `JAVA_HOME`)
- **Android SDK** with `platform-android-36` and `build-tools` matching AGP 8.13.2
- **Android NDK** is *not* required — VLC ships pre-built `.so` files for all 4 ABIs.
- **Git**, **Python 3** (for fastlane, optional)
- ~6 GB free disk space for Gradle caches and build outputs

### Clone & build

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/The-JDdev/SHS-Player.git
cd SHS-Player

# Build a debug APK (universal)
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APKs (per-ABI splits + universal)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build an App Bundle (.aab) for Play Store
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Or use Fastlane
bundle install                      # one-time
bundle exec fastlane build          # builds release APK + AAB
```

### Build variants

| Variant | Application ID suffix | Signature | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `debug` | `.debug` | Debug keystore (committed) | App name shows "SHS Player"; debuggable. |
| `release` | — | Your own keystore | R8 minify + resource shrink. Set up a `release` signing config in `app/build.gradle.kts` or pass via Fastlane env vars. |
| `release-with-debug-signing` | `.release` | Debug keystore | Same as `release` but signed with the debug key — useful for testing R8 on a real device without setting up release signing. |

### ABI splits

Release builds split into per-ABI APKs (smaller download size):
- `armeabi-v7a` (32-bit ARM — old devices)
- `arm64-v8a` (64-bit ARM — modern phones)
- `x86` (32-bit Intel/AMD — emulator)
- `x86_64` (64-bit Intel/AMD — emulator / Chromebook)
- `universal` (everything in one APK)

App Bundles (`bundleRelease`) disable the splits and let Google Play handle per-device delivery.

### Build outputs

```
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk
app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

---

## 🛠 Development

### Environment

- **IDE:** Android Studio (Ladybug or newer) or IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin
- **Kotlin:** 2.3.0
- **Gradle:** 9.3.1 (via wrapper — do not use a system Gradle)
- **KSP:** 2.3.4 (matches Kotlin)
- **Compose Compiler:** bundled with Kotlin 2.3.0 via `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`

### Code style

- **ktlint 12.3.0** is applied to every module via the root `build.gradle.kts`. Run:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew ktlintCheck       # check
  ./gradlew ktlintFormat      # auto-format
  ```
- Follow the existing Compose conventions: `@Stable` state holders, `remember<State>()` + `LaunchedEffect(player) { state.observe() }`, `compositionLocalOf` for cross-tree state.
- Use Hilt `@Inject` for constructor injection; never use field injection.
- Keep modules decoupled — `feature:*` modules must not depend on each other; `core:*` modules must not depend on `feature:*`.

### Tests

```bash
./gradlew test                         # JVM unit tests (core/domain has 8)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest         # Instrumented tests (core/database DAO tests)
```

Tests are configured with `ignoreFailures = true` at the root level — failures won't break the build, but please don't add broken tests.

### Debugging tips

- The **custom crash reporter** captures `logcat -d` at crash time and offers Share / Copy / Restart — useful when debugging on a device without ADB.
- `core/common/Logger.kt` wraps `Log.d/i/e` — use it instead of raw `Log.*` so logs can be toggled centrally in the future.
- `NextDispatchers` (`Default`, `IO`) is injected via Hilt — never use `Dispatchers.IO` directly in production code.
- Room schema exports are in `core/database/schemas/` — if you change `MediaDatabase`, generate a new schema and write a migration (do **not** use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`).

### Fastlane

The `fastlane/` folder automates Play Store publishing:

```bash
# Build (release APK + AAB)
bundle exec fastlane build

# Build + publish to Play Store Internal Track
bundle exec fastlane publish track:internal
```

Environment variables for signing:
- `KEYSTORE` — path to your `.keystore` / `.jks`
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `KEY_ALIAS`
- `KEY_PASSWORD`
- `PLAY_API_CREDENTIALS` — path to Play Store service-account JSON

## 🔐 Permissions Explained

SHS Player requests **only the permissions it needs** — no contact list, no location (except for Wi-Fi peer discovery metadata, never stored), no SMS, no call log.

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `INTERNET` | Streaming (DASH/HLS/RTSP), online subtitle search, IPTV, Wi-Fi transfer server. |
| `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` / `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (Android 13+) | Read your video and audio files. |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (≤ Android 12) | Read media on older Android versions. |
| `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (≤ Android 10) | Write to shared storage on pre-Scoped-Storage Android. |
| `MANAGE_MEDIA` | Bulk delete media via `MediaStore.createDeleteRequest` flow on Android 11+. |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Picture-in-Picture overlay on older Android; future overlay features. |
| `CAMERA` | QR scanner. |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Reserved for future voice-input features (not currently active). |
| `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` / `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` / `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` / `CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` / `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (Android 13+) | Wi-Fi file transfer, local-only hotspot, device discovery. |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Required by Android to expose Wi-Fi BSSID/SSID for the TrebleShot-style share format. **Never stored or transmitted.** |
| `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` (≤ Android 11) / `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` / `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` (Android 12+) | Reserved for future Bluetooth file transfer. |
| `USE_BIOMETRIC` / `USE_FINGERPRINT` | Privacy Vault biometric unlock. |

---

## 🛡 Privacy & Security

- **No data collection.** SHS Player does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information. There is no analytics SDK, no crash-reporting SDK, no ad SDK.
- **All processing is on-device.** Media decoding, thumbnail generation, subtitle parsing, charset detection, QR encoding — everything happens locally.
- **Wi-Fi File Transfer stays on your LAN.** The NanoHTTPD server binds to your local Wi-Fi interface; there is no cloud relay.
- **Privacy Vault files are stored in app-private storage** (`context.filesDir/vault/`) — invisible to other apps and to the gallery. They are deleted if you uninstall the app (so back them up first!).
- **Custom crash handler** stores crash logs locally and only shares them when you explicitly tap Share.
- **Open source.** Every line of code is auditable. If you find a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.
- The full privacy policy is in [`PRIVACY`](PRIVACY).

## 🌍 Internationalization

SHS Player is localised into **40+ languages** thanks to the upstream Next Player community and additional South-Asian language focus:

`ar` · `bg` · `bn` · `ca` · `cs` · `da` · `de` · `el` · `es` · `et` · `fa` · `fi` · `fr` · `hi` · `hu` · `ia` · `in` · `it` · `iw` · `ja` · `kn` · `ko` · `ml` · `nb-rNO` · `nl` · `pa` · `pl` · `pt` · `pt-rBR` · `ro` · `ru` · `sv` · `ta` · `th` · `tr` · `uk` · `ur` · `vi` · `zh-rCN` · `zh-rTW` (+ English default).

Particular emphasis on South-Asian scripts: **Bengali** (`bn`), **Hindi** (`hi`), **Punjabi** (`pa`), **Urdu** (`ur`), **Tamil** (`ta`), **Kannada** (`kn`), **Malayalam** (`ml`), **Persian** (`fa`), **Arabic** (`ar`).

**Want to add or improve a translation?** Open a PR with updated `strings.xml` in the relevant `values-*` folder under `core/ui/src/main/res/`. Weblate / Crowdin integration is on the roadmap.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

**Quick rules:**
1. Branch from `main`.
2. Run `./gradlew ktlintCheck` before committing.
3. Add tests for new logic where reasonable.
4. Don't bump the version number in your PR — the maintainer handles releases.
5. Don't change `applicationId` — it's pinned to `dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer` for upstream-compatibility and Play Store continuity.
6. Keep modules decoupled — no `feature:*` → `feature:*` dependencies.
7. Open an issue first for big architectural changes so we can discuss.

**Good first issues:** look for the `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels in the Issues tab.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is SHS Player really free?**  
A: Yes — free as in beer (no cost, no ads, no in-app purchases) and free as in speech (MIT-licensed open source).

**Q: Why two engines (ExoPlayer + VLC)?**  
A: ExoPlayer is fast and well-integrated with Android's media pipeline, but it can't play every codec/container. VLC fills the gaps — especially for niche codecs, broken files, and certain stream protocols. SHS Player picks the right engine per file (or you can force it in Decoder settings).

**Q: Where are my Privacy Vault files stored?**  
A: In app-private storage at `context.filesDir/vault/{videos,music}/`. They are invisible to other apps and to the gallery, and they are deleted if you uninstall SHS Player. **Back them up before uninstalling!**

**Q: Does Wi-Fi File Transfer send my files to the cloud?**  
A: No. The NanoHTTPD server binds to your local Wi-Fi interface. There is no cloud relay — only devices on the same Wi-Fi can reach it, and the 16-character UUID auth token prevents unauthorised access even on shared networks.

**Q: Why does the app need location permission?**  
A: On Android, accessing Wi-Fi SSID/BSSID (needed for the TrebleShot-style QR share format) requires `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`. SHS Player reads these values locally to populate the QR code; it never stores or transmits your location.

**Q: Can I add my own IPTV playlist?**  
A: Yes — open the **Watch TV** tab, tap the FAB / menu, and paste any `.m3u` URL or pick a local `.m3u` file. Eight free iptv-org playlists are bundled as defaults.

**Q: Why is the application ID `dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer`?**  
A: For upstream-compatibility and Play Store continuity. Changing the application ID would make SHS Player a different app and break updates for existing users.

**Q: How do I report a crash?**  
A: SHS Player has a built-in crash reporter. When the app crashes, you'll see a Crash screen with the stack trace and `logcat` output. Tap **Share** to send it via your preferred app, or **Copy** to paste it into a GitHub Issue.

**Q: Will my settings transfer from upstream Next Player?**  
A: Not automatically. SHS Player uses the same DataStore file names but with extended preference schemas. Install SHS Player fresh and reconfigure.

**Q: Is there a dark theme?**  
A: Three, actually: System (follows your device), On (always dark, with optional high-contrast / pure-black OLED mode), and Off (always light). Plus Material You dynamic theming on Android 12+.
